# my_kaggle_ml_practice
This repository contains my machine learning practice work developed using Google Colab and version-controlled with GitHub. I use Colab to write and run Jupyter notebooks, including GPU-based experiments when needed, and commit stable versions to GitHub for tracking progress, reproducibility, and easy sharing .
